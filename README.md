### Hi my name is Luz Di, thanks for the visit ðŸ‘‹

I'm a public accountant but I consider myself a versatile professional. In order to better understand the technology sector applied to the e-commerce payments market, I increased my knowledge of the product and engineering areas, through new courses and certifications.
In general, I have sought to understand how the design of a digital product has to satisfy both the customer experience needs and the profitability business needs.
Since 2012, I gained experience leading teams, inspiring ideas and developing talents. And since 2018, I have been working in the Fintech sector, venturing into the combination of Operations and Product, being the leader of both the processes and the development of PRD's for the company's internal tools.
I loved technology so much that I have expanded my academic preparation in the field of software and data science.
I believe that in the world of software, it is better to have concrete actions with good results than to wait for the perfect products to be launched on the market.
Not for nothing does the agile approach invite us to use iteration as a faster way to validate our business ideas.
Hoping to find in you as a reader, a next colleague, may the best of successes come for both of us.
Best regards.
